# Functional fitness test
Digital and extended functional YMCA fitness test

## The idea
While I was reading "Functional Fit" from Mulamba van der Hende, I got the idea for a digital fitness test tool. He describes how the YMCA uses a few simple exercises to determine your functional fitness.

Since I'm a marathon runner and a programmer, I thought it would be fun to combine these two hobbies.

I would like to test my own personal fitness on a regular base, preferably monthly. But that only make sence if you can track your progress and see (some kind of) improvement.

## The tests
By doing some exersices you can get some points. These points will represend your fitness.

The described tests are;
* 3 min step test
* Push-ups
* Flexibility (reaching)
* Sit-ups (half)
* Balance

Personal, I would like to extend these with at least the BMI.
